The purpose of this project is a simulation of a pizzeria, which consists of the
reception which accepts new orders, from several kitchens, themselves with several cooks, themselves
bake several pizzas.  
This allowed us to learn how to deal with various issues including load balancing, process and thread synchronization and communicate.  

We used:  
• Process (fork, exit, wait, ...)  
• Inter-Process Communication (IPC)  
• STL wires  
• POSIX threads (pthread_*)  

This project was made in 2 in c++ language
